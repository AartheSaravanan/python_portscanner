## **Port Scanner**

### Description

The Port Scanner is a Python script designed to scan a range of ports on a specified host and identify which ports are open. The script uses concurrent threading to efficiently scan up to 65,535 ports, providing quick results and real-time progress updates.

**Features:**
- **Scans a range of ports:** Allows users to specify the number of ports to scan, from 1 to 65,535.
- **Concurrent scanning:** Utilizes threading to scan multiple ports simultaneously for faster results.
- **Real-time progress updates:** Provides ongoing updates on the number of remaining ports during the scan.

**Intended Users:**
- **Network Administrators:** To check the availability of services and secure network configurations.
- **Security Professionals:** For assessing potential vulnerabilities by identifying open ports on target systems.
- **Developers:** To troubleshoot and ensure that necessary ports are accessible during development.


## Usage/Examples

---

## **Usage**

To use the port scanning script, follow these steps:

1. **Run the Script:**
   - Execute the script using Python from the command line or terminal.

   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
   ```

2. **Input the Target:**
   - Enter the domain name or IP address of the target host you want to scan.

3. **Specify the Number of Ports:**
   - Enter the number of ports you want to scan. The script will scan ports starting from 1 up to the number you specify (up to 65535).

### **Example**

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the script:

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python port_scanner.py
   ```

2. **Input the Target:**
   - When prompted, enter a domain name or IP address, such as `example.com` or `192.168.1.1`.

   ```
   Enter the target domain name or IP address: example.com
   ```

3. **Specify the Number of Ports:**
   - Enter the number of ports you want to scan. For example, to scan the first 100 ports:

   ```
   Enter the number of ports you want to scan (1-65535): 100
   ```

4. **View Results:**
   - The script will resolve the domain name to an IP address, start scanning the specified number of ports, and print out which ports are open.

   ```
   Resolved example.com to 93.184.216.34
   Starting scan on host: 93.184.216.34
   Scanning... 100 ports remaining
   22/tcp  open
   80/tcp  open
   ...
   ```

In this example, the script will scan the first 100 ports on `example.com` and print out any open ports it finds.
